                            <p>“[The universe] is like a play in which the scene and the general outline of the story is fixed by the author, but certain minor details are left for the actors to improvise.”</p>
                            <p>C.S. Lewis believed in a God like I do. He argued that we are co-creators with God in this play of life. His thoughts show that our agency matters in this life and has an effect. I have seen my choices influence how my life unfolds. If my whole story is already written by God, I wouldn’t have to make choices, it would simply unfold before me. I know this isn’t true as I have faced many decisions that I could have gone either way with. I chose to serve a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ. I chose to go to BYU over other institutions I was thinking about. I choose to put effort into my schoolwork. These choices are part of co-creating our story that is written with God. Having agency and making choices helps us learn and grow. C.S. Lewis bolsters the idea that agency is important for life.</p>

                            <p>In “The Allegory of the Cave”, a man chained in ignorance is freed and led to see the light. The light and knowledge come to represent his education of the truth. He experienced growth in his understanding, but gaining that knowledge was painful and hard. While this allegory may have initially been given to teach the manner of education, it also fits the purposes of my philosophy of life. We experience struggles and pains in life, but if those pains guide us to growth and truth, then we know that pain was for a purpose. This life is for us to become like God and to gain the knowledge He has, but it may be a painful experience because we must climb out from the depths of ignorance we previously were entrapped by. Gaining knowledge and experiencing growth through struggles is essential to understanding life.</p>

                            <p>“Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally. This kind of attention nurtures greater awareness, clarity, and acceptance of present-moment reality. It wakes us up to the fact that our lives unfold only in moments.”</p>
                            <p>Jon Kabat-Zin teaches about mindfulness and meditation. I admit that this doesn’t fit nicely into my philosophy of life, but it has been one of the most impactful things I have learned in my study of philosophy. I am absorbed in this world of all gas, no brakes. When I  eat, I bring up a YouTube video to watch. When someone is talking to me, I find it hard to focus and start thinking about other things on my mind. Only yesterday was I at a devotional, and for much of it, I was people-watching and distracting myself with my thoughts. This lack of being in the moment is a problem for me. Practicing mindfulness has been the solution I have needed. My philosophy of life is about making choices and growing to become more like God. If I’m not living every moment of this life, then the experiences that help me grow will pass by. God wants us to experience life, not to numb ourselves to stimulus and let life pass by. Even if mindfulness isn’t written in as part of my philosophy of life, it is the backbone because without being present in my experiences, why experience life at all?</p>

                            <p>“He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks)from day to day to diminish (his doing).
                                He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action, there is nothing which he does not do.”
                                </p>
                                <p>While I may not completely understand all that Lao-tzu is trying to argue for, I feel he goes against what I said in writing about C.S. Lewis. From my understanding, Taoism seeks to be in harmony with nature and to go with the flow of the universe. What I disagree with is what Lao-tzu teaches in the quote that we are to stop doing things for our purposes. It seems this teaching leads one to do what the universe wants if you aren’t doing what you seek to do on purpose. I disagree with this way of living since we are co-creators with God and not simply a pawn of the universe. If we went with the flow of the universe, there would be little use of agency and, therefore, little growth. But I must admit that submitting to the will of God is an element of obedience to God, so there may be some ties to going with the flow of the universe. In the end, there is some merit to what Lao-tzu is saying, but there are also times when God/the universe isn’t guiding us in a direction, and we are left to grow by using our agency.</p>
